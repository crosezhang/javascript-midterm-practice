# Question 5

For optimal viewing in GradeScope, we ask you to keep the lines to 70
characters long. This paragraph is an example showcasing this
practice.
It is not required that each line is exactly 70 characters long. In
particular, do not break words to meet this specification. It is
sufficient to use this paragraph as a reference. When you reach
roughly 70 characters, hit enter to go to the next line and continue
writing.

Please write your answer under each heading.

## Part 1
myMethod1 returns undefined because the way the function is defined, it creates a new
function scope which means that the method no longer has access to the object named "this."
This is not the case for anonymous functions since they inherit the scope of whatever environment
they are defined in, which is why myMethod2 has access to "this."

## Part 2
API aids the communication between requests from the client (aka the computer) and responses from
the service side (aka the server/database storing the information). The API specifically handles
the intersection between the client and the server (receiving requests and transferring back information).
Programming on the client side is called front-end development while working the server side is called
back-end development.
